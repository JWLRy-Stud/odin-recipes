# odin-recipes
my journey with odin project is doing great! 
First, I've learned how to use and set up virtual machine using oracle virtual box 
and run xubuntu os to it.
second I've learned basic terminal commands like cd, ls, mkdir,touch, mv and rm
these commands are used to navigate and create directory and files.
Third I've learned basic commands in git like git push, status, add, commit and how to create a repository in github and set up ssh key.
Fourth is basic html structure, tags, content, element and some interesting tag like anchor tag 
which allows links or hyperlinks to be added in to the webpage and relative and absolute url and also the attributes that make links secure.
