        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare lasagna noodles according to package directions. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the meat sauce. Pour oil into a pan over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic; cook until aromatic. Add ground beef and cook until lightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                
                Add tomato sauce, Knorr Beef Cube, and banana ketchup; mix well. Add pepper, bay leaves, and oregano. Simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the white sauce: Heat a small saucepan over medium flame. Add butter and melt. Stir in flour and cook until it becomes pasty.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly whisk milk into pan and season with nutmeg. Continue to cook until slightly thickened into a gravy-like consistency. If the sauce has thickened too much, add more milk or water to thin it out.
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, layer lasagna noodles in a rectangular baking dish. Pour some meat sauce over the pasta, followed by some white sauce. Sprinkle some cheese over this layer. Continue layering, ending with cheese on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Serve hot.
            </li>
